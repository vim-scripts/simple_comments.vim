This is a plugin to comment out or remove comments from
lines in sourcecode using the comments in the commentsring
variable. It is intended to be as simple as possible and can only
handle the commenting or removal of comments from whole 
lines.

There are much more sofisticated comment scripts on vim.org, but I wanted something simple, so this script was created.
